                 an interactive AI-driven learning game 🐳 ⎈
```

> *No web app. No video courses.*
> *Just you, your AI editor, a terminal, and mass amounts of coffee.* ☕

An open-source, interactive learning game where your AI becomes a friendly mentor
and walks you through real-world DevOps scenarios — from "what's a container?"
all the way to triaging a Kubernetes production incident at 3 AM.

## How It Works

```
  You                     AI Editor                  Your Terminal
  ---                     ---------                  -------------

  "let's play"  ------>   reads game files   -----> checks Docker

```

You just joined **NoCappuccino**, a fast-growing coffee subscription startup where
things are... a bit chaotic. Sarah, your senior DevOps engineer, will guide you
through the mess. Dave (the CTO) keeps breaking things. Marcus (the PM) keeps
setting deadlines. The coffee machine breaks as often as production.

| Ch | Title | Scenario | You'll Learn |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|
| Ch | Title | Scenario | You'll Learn |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | 📦 **It Works on My Machine** | Dave's API crashes on staging | containers, images, port mapping |
| 2 | 🏋️ **The 2GB Espresso** | Image is 2GB, deploys take forever | multi-stage builds, layer caching, .dockerignore |
| 3 | 💾 **The Vanishing Beans** | Customer data gone after restart | volumes, bind mounts, persistence |
| 4 | 🔌 **The Silent Grinder** | Demo in 2 hrs, services can't talk | DNS, bridge networks, isolation |
| 5 | 🎼 **The Symphony of Steam** | New devs take 3 days to set up | Docker Compose, health checks, secrets |
| 6 | ⎈ **The Giant Roaster** | Influencer tweet melts the server | Pods, Deployments, Services, self-healing |
| 7 | 🔥 **The Great Latte Leak** | 3 things broke, CTO on a flight | rolling updates, Secrets, HPA, chaos triage |

Along the way you'll naturally pick up **Linux fundamentals** (namespaces, cgroups, filesystem mounts) and **networking concepts** (DNS, NAT, subnets, iptables) — without ever sitting through a networking lecture.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```
  .------------------------------------------------.
  |  Required                Optional (Ch 6-7)     |
  |  --------                ------------------    |
  |  [x] Docker              [ ] kubectl           |
  |  [x] Docker Compose v2   [ ] kind              |
  |  [x] AI editor                                 |
  |      (Claude Code / Cursor)                    |
  '------------------------------------------------'
```

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericboy0224/learn-docker-and-k8s.git
cd learn-docker-and-k8s
```

Then open it in your AI editor and type: **"let's play"**

That's it. The AI handles everything else.

## What Makes This Different

```
  Traditional Course            This Project
  ------------------            ------------

  📺 Watch a video              🎮 Play a game
  📝 Follow step-by-step        🔍 Investigate & fix
  😴 Passive consumption        💪 Active problem-solving
  🏫 Classroom setting          🏢 Simulated real job
  📖 Isolated concepts          🔗 Everything connects
  🤖 Generic examples           ☕ Coffee startup story
```

- 🧠 **AI as game engine** — The prompt files ARE the game code. No server needed.
- 📖 **Story-driven** — Characters, stakes, humor. Dave will break things.
- 🖥️ **Real environments** — Actual Docker & K8s on your machine.
- 🔒 **Challenge mode** — The AI won't give answers, only progressive hints.
- 🔗 **Cross-learning** — Docker teaches you Linux & networking for free.
- 🛡️ **Safe sandbox** — All resources use `learn-` prefix. Easy cleanup. No host damage.
